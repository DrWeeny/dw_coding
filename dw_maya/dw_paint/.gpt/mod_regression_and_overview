Key Implementations:


Moved from scipy to numpy-based operations
Added caching system for mesh data
Vectorized operations for performance
Implemented comprehensive validation
Created class-based APIs for major operations


Main Features Moved/Reorganized:


flood_value_on_sel → operations/flood.py
interpolate_vertex_map → core/interpolation.py
mirror_vertex_map → operations/mirror.py
Vector operations → core/vectors.py
Weight modifications → core/weights.py


Next Steps:


Remove remaining scipy dependencies
Test for regressions
Verify all functionality is properly exposed
Ensure backward compatibility
Add tests for all components
Review memory management
Check performance optimizations
