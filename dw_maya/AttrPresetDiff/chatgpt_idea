This sounds like an excellent feature to implement! To incorporate a "diff" capability with options to accept, remove, or blend attributes between the loaded JSON and the current object attributes, we can break this task into the following steps:

Steps to Implement the Feature
Extract Attributes:

Read the attributes from the JSON (loaded preset).
Get the current object's attributes via Maya's cmds or your existing utilities.
Compare Attributes:

Identify matching attributes (present in both the JSON and the object).
Identify missing attributes (present in the JSON but not on the object).
Identify extra attributes (present on the object but not in the JSON).
Present Differences to the User:

Use a UI element to display the differences (e.g., a tree view, table, or checkboxes).
Allow users to select which attributes to accept, remove, or blend.
Apply Changes:

For accepted attributes, overwrite the object's values with the JSON values.
For blended attributes, calculate the new values based on the specified blend percentage.
Implementation Plan
1. Extract Attributes
Modify loadNode to include a comparison step. For example:

python
Copier le code
def loadNode(self, json_path, blend=1.0):
    """
    Load node attributes from a JSON file and compare them against the current object attributes.

    Args:
        json_path (str): Path to the JSON file.
        blend (float): Blending percentage (1.0 = full JSON, 0.0 = full current object).
    """
    # Load JSON attributes
    json_attrs = dw_json.load_json(json_path)
    if not json_attrs:
        cmds.warning(f"Failed to load JSON: {json_path}")
        return

    # Get current object attributes
    current_attrs = self.get_all_attrs()  # Replace with your attribute-fetching method

    # Compare attributes
    diff = self.compare_attributes(current_attrs, json_attrs)

    # Present the differences and allow user actions (accept, remove, blend)
    self.present_diff_ui(diff, blend)
2. Compare Attributes
Create a method to compare attributes:

python
Copier le code
def compare_attributes(self, current_attrs, json_attrs):
    """
    Compare the current object attributes with the loaded JSON attributes.

    Args:
        current_attrs (dict): Attributes of the current object.
        json_attrs (dict): Attributes loaded from the JSON.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the diff:
            - "matching": Attributes present in both.
            - "missing": Attributes in JSON but not on the object.
            - "extra": Attributes on the object but not in JSON.
    """
    matching = {key: (current_attrs[key], json_attrs[key])
                for key in current_attrs.keys() & json_attrs.keys()}
    missing = {key: json_attrs[key]
               for key in json_attrs.keys() - current_attrs.keys()}
    extra = {key: current_attrs[key]
             for key in current_attrs.keys() - json_attrs.keys()}

    return {
        "matching": matching,
        "missing": missing,
        "extra": extra
    }
3. Present Differences to the User
Use a UI dialog to display the differences and capture user preferences. For example, a tree view or table can list attributes in categories like Matching, Missing, and Extra.

Example:

python
Copier le code
def present_diff_ui(self, diff, blend):
    """
    Present a UI to show the attribute differences and capture user actions.

    Args:
        diff (dict): The diff dictionary containing matching, missing, and extra attributes.
        blend (float): Default blending percentage.
    """
    # Pseudo-code for UI implementation
    print("Matching Attributes:")
    for key, (current, loaded) in diff["matching"].items():
        print(f"{key}: Current = {current}, Loaded = {loaded} (Blend: {blend})")

    print("Missing Attributes (from JSON):")
    for key, value in diff["missing"].items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

    print("Extra Attributes (on Object):")
    for key, value in diff["extra"].items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

    # Placeholder for UI actions (accept, remove, blend)
    # Example: Launch a PySide dialog for user selection
4. Apply Changes
Implement a method to apply the changes based on user input:

python
Copier le code
def apply_changes(self, selected_attrs, json_attrs, current_attrs, blend):
    """
    Apply user-selected changes to the object's attributes.

    Args:
        selected_attrs (list): List of attributes selected for changes.
        json_attrs (dict): Attributes loaded from the JSON.
        current_attrs (dict): Current object attributes.
        blend (float): Blending percentage (1.0 = full JSON, 0.0 = full current object).
    """
    for attr in selected_attrs:
        if attr in json_attrs and attr in current_attrs:
            # Blend matching attributes
            current_value = current_attrs[attr]
            json_value = json_attrs[attr]
            new_value = current_value * (1.0 - blend) + json_value * blend
            self.set_attr(attr, new_value)
        elif attr in json_attrs:
            # Apply missing attributes
            self.set_attr(attr, json_attrs[attr])
        elif attr in current_attrs:
            # Remove extra attributes
            self.remove_attr(attr)
Example Flow
User Action:

Load a preset via loadNode.
Comparison:

Attributes are categorized into Matching, Missing, and Extra.
User Selection:

The user selects attributes to accept, remove, or blend via the UI.
Application:

The system applies the changes, blending values as necessary.
Next Steps
Implement the UI for attribute selection (a PySide dialog with checkboxes or sliders for blending).
Test edge cases, such as mismatched attribute types or missing data.
Integrate the feature into your existing workflows.
